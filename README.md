# RNN-Tensorflow
Learning to implement an various types of Recurrent Neural Network for modelling sequenced data\
Vanilla RNN\
LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)\
Bi-directional RNN\
A RNN(recurrent neural network) is a type of neural network that is good at understanding the time relation between data. We will be using Tensorflow to program these. All the models will be built from scratch without using the prebuilt methods and classes like the BasicLSTMCell to get a better understanding of the inner working of a network.
All data will be stored in the data directory. We might use different but similar datasets for each individual network.
